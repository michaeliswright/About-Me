<p>One of my favorite toys I still buy today are LEGO, having maintained a large collection and no signs of slowing down</p>
<P>A hobby born out of a pet peeve was my taste of music, I dont usually like modern songs, and would spend time finding songs from the 20's to the 90's, where the tone and messeges were much more appropriate</P>
<p>I am a fan of Star Wars, I remember growing up and loving them, I'm however not into the new films. But I spend my time in online forms and communities.</p>
<p>PC gaming is still a big hobby of mine, I dont play well know titles like Call of Duty, I play historical games such as Holdfast and War Thunder</p>

<h2>My Studies</h2>
<p>At Ivy Tech, I'm studing Graphics for a certificate, and minoring in History, I have leared many skills in Photoshop, Illustrator, AutoCAD, and I hope to get into video editing.</p>
<p>I hope to be able to transfer to film school, or learn animation, anything that I can do and find fun.</p>
